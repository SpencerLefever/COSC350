Algorithm for basic signal questions

1. Create a signal handler to handle signals
    signal handler for most test questions with just have to handle SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
    void sig_handler(int sigNo) {
        if(sigNo == SIGUSR1) {
            //Do something
        }
        else if(sigNo == SIGUSR2) {
            //Do something
        }
    }
    Note: This example would most likely be used when parent and child both have to send signals

2. Call signal system call to "link" signal and sig_handler
    signal(SIGUSR1, sig_handler)
    signal(SIGUSR2, sig_handler)

3. For most signal questions, a parent or child will send a signal to the other using kill
    kill(getppid(), SIGUSR1);
